# SNR_ResNet50
Repository for "Neural Networks classes" on WUT. Our main goal is to analize and visualize how the network learns and how it reacts to changes as transfer learning, SVM substitution and architecture simplification. For visualization we will be using Class Activation Map (CAM) and DeepDream technique. Data set used: https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset
